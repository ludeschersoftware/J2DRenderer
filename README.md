# üéÆ Scenes as the Core of the Game Loop

In **MonoGame**, the starting point of every project is the `Game` class.  
You inherit from it, and it provides the core game loop: `Initialize ‚Üí LoadContent ‚Üí Update ‚Üí Draw`.  

For our engine, we‚Äôre taking a similar approach ‚Äî but instead of a single `Game` class,  
we introduce a **base `Scene` class**. Every part of the game (main menu, test level, gameplay, etc.)  
will inherit from this base class and build its own logic on top.

---

## üå± The Base Scene

The `Scene` class is where our rendering and update journey begins.  
By inheriting from it, we get a few things out of the box:

- **`IsMouseVisible`**  
  A flag to show or hide the cursor.  
  Default: `false`.

- **`Update(GameTime gameTime)`**  
  Runs once per frame.  
  Gives access to the `GameTime` object so we can easily track  
  delta time and frame timing.

- **`Draw(GameTime gameTime)`**  
  Also runs once per frame, but for rendering.  
  The `GameTime` parameter keeps timing info consistent with `Update`.

---

## üé® Graphics Device Abstraction

To keep things flexible, we don‚Äôt lock ourselves into one rendering API.  
Instead, we introduce a **`GraphicsDevice`** that decides *how* a scene is rendered:

- `Canvas2DContext` ‚Üí simple 2D rendering.  
- `WebGLContext` ‚Üí GPU-accelerated rendering with shaders.  
- (Future) `WebGPUContext` ‚Üí modern GPU pipeline.

This way, scenes don‚Äôt care which backend they‚Äôre running on ‚Äî  
they just use the `GraphicsDevice`.

---

## üñºÔ∏è SpriteBatch

Like MonoGame, we can add a **`SpriteBatch`** utility.  
This class helps batch multiple draw calls together, making 2D rendering faster and simpler.

Use it to:  
- Draw textures and sprites.  
- Batch them efficiently to minimize state changes.  
- Keep rendering code clean and easy to read.

---

## üöÄ Putting It Together

- Think of `Scene` as our version of MonoGame‚Äôs `Game` class.  
- Each scene is self-contained: it updates logic and renders visuals.  
- The `GraphicsDevice` decides whether we render with Canvas2D or WebGL.  
- `SpriteBatch` makes sprite rendering easy and efficient.

This structure gives us a **flexible, scalable foundation** for building games ‚Äî  
starting simple, but with room to grow into more advanced rendering pipelines.
